# To-Do App

## Description

This app is the final project of a React course through Yoco. This app is built using React and CSS Modules. The goal of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of all of the essential components of React development. This app was not meant to be styled aggressively, it was meant to be a vessel for functionality to be shown. However, some improvements have been made from the basic design. The development process can be followed through the issues and project workflow. As this app was built loosely from a design, the design is shown below.

## Usage

This app is a typical `create-react-app` react project, so all relevant lifecycle commands in `package.json` apply. Here, I just list the most common/useful commands for this project.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```
